SDL2VectorAsteroids
===================

Vector Asteroids made using SDL2 in C++ Version 3.83

Requires libraries Vmath http://bartipan.net/vmath/ as well as SDL2 http://www.libsdl.org/.

Now using the new C++ 11 http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/mersenne_twister_engine/ Random Number Generator. Boost no longer being used.
Thank you Pat for letting me know it was in C++ 11.
