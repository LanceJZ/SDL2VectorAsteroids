        <h5>This is my remake of Asteroids I made using C++ 11 and SDL2. I will share every single video game I create in the future as well. You can download the compiled for Windows game from here <a href="Vector Asteroids SDL2.rar">Vector Asteroids</a> you will likely need the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio C++ 2013 runtime</a> for Windows to run the game. Most people will need the runtime from Microsoft so please install the runtime before you run the game. Most game publishers are still using 2008, and a few are using 2010 so it is extremely unlikely you would have it installed already. The reason I used the 2013 version is because it has good support for C++11 and I love the IDE. The game plays on Windows XP, 7 and 8. It is free and open source. The game does not have an installer and it needs write access because it saves your high scores, so the best place to extract the game to is your documents, desktop or some other unrestricted folder. This is so it can save the high score, otherwise it will crash if it can not write to the folder. Just run Asteroids.exe from there after the runtime is installed. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it! Thank you.</h5>

        I created a line based font using nothing but lines for this game that I will use in other vector type games I create as well. The game took me about twenty hours to make, and about another hundred cleaning, debugging and tweaking. I used some of the code from a previous version. If I make a future version it will have different colors for the lines that the user can chose. I'll also make it so you can trade your high scores with your friends if I get interest in it.
        I enjoyed learning more C++ 11 and SDL2. It really helped to make a game to learn so much. Now I'm onto my next game Vector Omega Race. I've gotten pretty far with that game, and I plan on going back to Asteroids and make a few changes from things I have learned from a more complex game. I will add it soon, and place the link on my <a href="https://lancejz.github.io/">Main page.</a></h5>
